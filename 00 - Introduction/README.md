Python is a high-level programming language. It has a wide range of use-cases in the real world, mostly on fields like web development, data science and analytics, artificial intelligence, application development, and many more. Most importantly Python is very easy to learn. This is because Python handles all the hard work for you - you just have to learn its simple syntax.
